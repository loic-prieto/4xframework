# Standard Plugin - Civilization - Population in cities

The population is at the core of a civilization. Indeed, everything that can be done by a civilization is done though 
the population.

Population grows in cities given the right health conditions. I would like population to grow based on a realistic 
model, taking into account health conditions, access to food, economic classes, time passed between each turn, etc.

The working population, that is, the population that counts to produce goods is a fraction of the total population. 
The non active population has to be supported. When health conditions improve (by modernizing sanitation and having 
better access to food sources), the age expectancy improves too, and the number of people to be supported outside the 
active age increases as an absolute number (as opposed to a relative number, which should remain the same). So, having 
more people gives a definitive advantage to many resources, but also increase the burden to support them, which means 
that some planning is required so that the overall population can support the social needs of the society.

Everything that is produced is produced by the population, as in X amount of citizens are needed to produce Y thing. 
X amount of citizens may be consumed as part of that production for different reasons (for example, a military unit 
may need 1000 citizens to be part of that unit, or a building needs human sacrifices). This opens the way for 
later-stage gameplay that may trade off resource cost vs manpower cost as in robotization.

It may be interesting to put a cap on the different type of citizens that can exist for a given period of time, 
since it wouldn't be realistic to use population as a fungible resource that can be used for anything, unless we're 
talking about forced labor. Population can be divided on blue collar - white collar and other categories. 
This should be very carefully though out, because it may become unfun to the gameplay.
