# 4X Framework - Standard Plugin - Population Growth

## The realistic model

As read on different sources, the population growth follows a 5-step evolution (the demographic transition):
- high mortality, high birth rates - The population remains low and stable
- diminishing mortality, high birth rates - The population starts to grow a lot
- low mortality, diminishing birth rates - The population growth decelerates
- low mortality, low birth rates - The population stabilises or may even start diminishing, but from a very high population count
[Population growth stages](http://papp.iussp.org/sessions/papp101_s01/images/demographic_transition.png)

Most of the growth occurs during the second phase, when health conditions improve greatly but birth rates remain the same,
which means that growth is unchecked. In human history this has happened in the western world at around 1700-1800 with the
progress of medicine and the needs of nation states to have bigger population to support the world conquering ambitions that
can only be fueled by strong economies and high population cap to feed the armies.

In game terms:
- better health tech
- better agricultural tech

## Downsides to population growth

There are very few downsides to have more population from a game of world conquering point of view (which civ kinda is) 
(more resources), so we need to find ways to balance this with issues:
- you need to generate enough food, or there will be famine. Famine should be devastating, not just losing population points,
but having civil wars and open rebellion (this also opens the way to asymmetric wars)
- more population means more needs to satisfy, more political and social unrest
- cities can be crowded. The more population there is, the more health services there should be and the cost of these services
depend on the population number. If you reduce health services, there should be unhappiness and mortality.
- A crowded city propagates infections faster

The general decision, though, should be to want to have more people.

## War, as a population sink

Military units need people to build them. As in a unit of warriors may need 1000 people in it. These units are lost to 
the city the unit is produced in. They may recovered if the unit is disbanded.
This means that warmonger civilizations have less population to do other things, but it also means that overcrowded 
cities (or cities with a lot of dissidents) can reduce their problems by sending away these people (although units composed
of unhappy people should be underperformant)

## Constrains to growth

Several factors constrain the population growth. On the first 2 steps of the growth evolution, birth rates are at the
maximum level, meaning women produce children unrestricted as long as they are of age (18\[the usual marrying age for
most women in medieval times\]-40), one per year. Meaning, if 50% of the population are women, [and 65% of these are
between 15 and 64 years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_world#Age_structure), we can estimate that
50%.50% (we're only interested in 18-40) = 25% of the total population produces 1 additional person per year.
This changes with age composition for older societies (rather, with health facilities available), where the life expectancy
after childhood may be 40-60 in the more common case. So, the percentage of the population that may produce one aditional
person per year may increase (since fertile women may represent a greater % of the total population).

From this maximum, we have to substract child/infant mortality, which accounts for most of the deaths of ancient times,
aside from wars/famines/diseases. This is a function of health facilities available to the populace. In these times, 
[child/infant mortality may go up to 40%-50%](https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality). Current C/I mortatility rates in
 Europe [are in average 0,36%](https://www.ined.fr/en/everything_about_population/data/europe-developed-countries/birth-death-infant-mortality/).
 
Food is another constraint. Not having enough food will cause famine. Famine, looking at various sources of past famines,
may take between 2 and 5% of the population, between outright hunger and then diseases associated to lack of a healthy
food intake (Malaria mostly, but also Cholera, Dysentery, etc). Famine also causes a breakdown of society, greatly hampering
production capabilities and provoking revolutions and rebellions.

Education and wealth reduce the fertility of women. The more a child costs to rear, the less are produced. Current fertility
rates for european countries: (1,58 per woman). Ancient fertility rates: 6-14 per woman (remember: 40% child mortality rate).
