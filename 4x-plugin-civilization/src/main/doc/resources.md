# Standard Plugin - Civilization - Resources 

This is an overview of what base resources exist for the standard plugin civilization and what their use may be.

## Overview

At the most primitive level, no resource aside from manpower, is needed to produce things: buildings, public works, units.
Stone and wood are used as the most basic resources and these are available without limit.

As technology progresses, specific resources may be needed to produce things. Weapons may need iron, trucks may need gas,
supermarkets may need plastic, hospitals may need electricity, etc.

Resources are extracted from extraction buildings which may be built in the map if it is a natural resource, or in a city
if it's a derived or artificial resource.

General rules of resource storage and transportation are kept from the standard  plugin

## Resource production

To extract a resource from the map, a city has to build specific public works. For example: a mine, a farm, an oil rig.

These public works may be built both on cities and colonies.
