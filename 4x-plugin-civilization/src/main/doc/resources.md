# Standard Plugin - Civilization - Resources 

This is an overview of what base resources exist for the standard plugin civilization and what their use may be.

## Overview

At the most primitive level, no resource aside from manpower, is needed to produce things: buildings, public works, units.
Stone and wood are used as the most basic resources and these are available without limit.

As technology progresses, specific resources may be needed to produce things. Weapons may need iron, trucks may need gas,
supermarkets may need plastic, hospitals may need electricity, etc.

Resources are extracted from extraction buildings which may be built in the map if it is a natural resource, or in a city
if it's a derived or artificial resource.

General rules of resource storage and transportation are kept from the standard  plugin

## Resource production

To extract a resource from the map, a city has to build specific public works. For example: a mine, a farm, an oil rig.

These public works may be built both on cities and colonies.

The extractive/transformative buildings will produce a fixed amount of resource that can be increased by other buildings,
better tech, more manpower.

## Industrialized harvesting

Aside from minerals and long-term produced chemicals like petroleum or gas, organic resources that can only otherwise be
found nature, can be farmed or synthesized from other resources.

Once a natural resource is discovered and exploited, it can be farmed with the given technology. Some animals/chemicals
cannot be farmed or reproduced, only things that have been proven to be farmable in the real world. For example: cattle,
silk worms, crustaceans are farmable, but whales and crocodiles aren't. 

A city can build pastures and farms to produce organic resources, it can also build factories to produce derived resources:
food, furs, leather, canned food, electricity, steel, clothes.

These derived resources in turn produce different effects on the population and are needed for maximum growth and happiness.

## A balanced resource diet

As part of human health conditions, cities need to receive a balanced food intake. The more different food sources are
used when processing food in factories, the more healthy it is for the population, increasing life expectancy and reducing
illness. The opposite is true.

The same thing happens with luxury goods. Having only one luxury good even in abundance provides a limited happiness. The
more different luxury resources a city receives, the more happiness the population enjoys. This encourages trading (or 
expansion).

## Artificial resources

A city may build factories to produce artificial resources. Food, clothes,steel, electricity, etc. These factories may 
be built too in colonies.

Artificial resources are resources like the others, that can be distributed and traded.
